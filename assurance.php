                    <h5>Assurance </h5>
                    <p class="mt-3">Assurance services are audit  related activities that provide an independent assessment of financial statements or compliance efforts. The objectives of these audits are to assure management  and regulators that financial statements are accurate and operations are done in complied with applicable  regulations. These compliance, regulatory, and financial statement audits are all considered assurance services. </p>

                    <p>Regulatory and compliance audits are key component of  assurance services. They are essentially involved to  ensure that an organization's operations are complied with  guidelines and rules set forth in either legislation or policy. Regulatory audits are those that test compliance with laws and regulations, while compliance audits are those that test against policies.</p>
                    <p>The most common example of assurance services are financial statement audits. According to the regulation known as the <b>Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</b>, U.S. companies that are publicly traded on the stock exchange must have their quarterly and annual financial statements audited by an independent, external public accounting firm.</p>
